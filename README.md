# Financial Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project trains a BERT model for financial sentiment analysis, aiming to classify financial text data into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This sentiment can be valuable for many financial applications, including trading algorithms, market analysis, or economic forecasting.

The current implementation involves the use of a pre-trained BERT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, fine-tuned on a specific financial sentiment dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch
- Transformers

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

python run.py


This command fine-tunes a BERT model on the provided financial dataset and saves the training logs in `training.log`.

## Files

- `dataset.py`: Contains the `FinancialDataset` class for handling the dataset.
- `data_processing.py`: Contains the `prepare_data` function for preparing the training and testing datasets.
- `model.py`: Contains the `get_model` and `get_trainer` functions for getting the model and the trainer.
- `run.py`: The main script that runs the whole process.

## Future Enhancements

While the current project serves as a good starting point for financial sentiment analysis, there are many potential enhancements that could be made:

1. **Use of Larger and More Diverse Datasets:** The quality of a sentiment analysis model heavily depends on the quality and size of the dataset used. For future work, gathering a larger and more diverse dataset, ideally annotated by experts in the financial domain, could help to improve the model's performance.

2. **Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques:** More advanced techniques for model fine-tuning and regularization, such as adversarial training or the use of learning rate schedules, could potentially improve the model's performance.

3. **Ensemble Models:** Combining the predictions of multiple models can often lead to more accurate predictions than any individual model. For future work, an ensemble of several models, potentially including models other than BERT, could be considered.

4. **Sentiment Over Time:** An interesting extension would be to track the sentiment over time and correlate it with market indicators to build a market sentiment index.
